         Through my training and experience, I have come to understand that setting goals is the best way to find 
         the path you want to follow. Knowing how to focus on the essential by investing time on the acquisition of
         skills and on the application of these in real situations is my method of working to achieve the goals 
         set. Planning, organizing, communicating are key words to facilitate tasks and improve productivity and 
         thus facilitate the growth of earnings but it is not enough to know all this to ensure success, because 
         there will always be obstacles to slow down our race

        Productivity, the biggest problem for young people, it is often difficult to find the motivation to move 
        forward with one's projects even when the objectives have been identified. Being productive does not 
        consist in doing a lot of tasks in a row, but it s to do the important tasks necessary to achieve the 
        objectives. Each person has peaks of productivity at different times. The expressions "being in the 
        morning" for example are part of the common language. In order to be efficient, we must be able to 
        organize our work time in such a way as to optimize our ability to concentrate and achieve our tasks 
        more easily.

      So,we could think that with precise objectives and motivations capable of overcoming any procrastination,
      no obstacle can prevent us from reaching our objectives and yet the number of cancelled or delayed projects 
      keeps growing on the pile of documents on a desk covered with dust. So the question to ask is why? To tell
      the truth, nobody knows and there is no real answer to this question, it is often difficult to follow the
      thread at the end of the adventure, knowing if we will succeed remains the biggest question, but it is 
      this feeling that pushes us to try and thus discover how far we can go.
